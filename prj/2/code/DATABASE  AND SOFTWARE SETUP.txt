create a database in MySQL called workouttracker with the following parameters

root password = CamelRacer9000      ---for database connection itself
admin username = db_admin_5003
admin password = 8523programming@62

then import the four sql files from the MYSQL folder

import the workoutTracker project to eclipse

                                      *******************************
make sure that you have installed swing into eclipse, as well as all necessary software components to run JFrames 
(This program relies heavily on JFrames and JFrame components to properly function)
